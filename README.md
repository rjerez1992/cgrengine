# CGR Engine 
Web based concept engine with limited features to create 2D MMO(A)RPGs. Instructions for deployment are avaible on the user manual in the docs folder (only in spanish). Developed as a university project.

### Features ###

* Maps
* Player and classes
* Chat
* Example spells (hardcoded for action based combat)
* Music (hardcoded)

I'm planning a re-write of all the client code to Typescript, since JS code ended up beign a big f. mess. Now here are some pictures.
